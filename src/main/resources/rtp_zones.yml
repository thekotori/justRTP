# '/rtpzone setup <id>'
#
# Explanation of a Zone:
#   <zone_id>: A unique name for your zone.
#
#   world: The name of the world where the zone region is located.
#   pos1 & pos2: The two corner points of the zone cuboid.
#
#   interval: The time in seconds for the global teleport timer.
#
#   target: The destination world (on this server) or server (on your proxy network).
#
#   min-radius & max-radius: The min/max distance for the random teleport from the world's center.
#
#   min-spread-distance & max-spread-distance (Optional):
#     Overrides the default player spread in config.yml for this specific zone.
#     This controls how far apart players land from each other.
#
#   effects (Optional): Customize sounds, titles, and action bars for this specific zone.
#     If this section is omitted, the global effects from config.yml will be used.
#     on_enter: Effects that play the moment a player enters the zone.
#     on_leave: Effects that play the moment a player leaves the zone.
#     waiting: Effects that play during the countdown for players inside the zone.
#     teleport: Effects that play at the moment of teleportation.
#
#   hologram (Optional): This section is managed by the /rtpzone sethologram and delhologram commands.
